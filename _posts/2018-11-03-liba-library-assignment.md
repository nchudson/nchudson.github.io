For years, I've known that I have absolute pitch, which is the ability to identify the name of a pitch or recreate any pitch without a reference tone. However, I've never known quite what to make of it. I know numerous musicians more advanced than myself who do not have this ability, and I've only met one or two who do. In order to learn more about this ability, I searched the George Fox library and found the article *Individual differences in absolute pitch performance: Contributions of working memory, musical expertise, and tonal language background* by *Stephen C. Van Hedger* and *Howard C. Nusbaum*.

This article speaks about the variance in absolute pitch ability among those who possess it. Although most people think of absolute pitch, or AP as a binary ability, either you have it or you don't, Hedger and Nusbaum explore the fact that not all AP abilities are equal. While foundations for AP are a combination of genetic disposition and early musical exposure and training, recent musical exposure, along with whether or not AP possessors speak a tonal language, can change possessors' ability to accurately and quickly identify pitches. During their experimentation Hedger and Nusbaum learned that some AP possessors were not able to easily identify pitches played on uncommon instruments or instruments that produce strange harmonics. Overall, this article helped me to learn more about the factors in developing and training absolute pitch.
